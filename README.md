# TM470-Project
Developing a web application to facilitate Appointment management and communication among support staff.

Problem description
A charity runs a community based supported living project in the UK. They plan to replace their current paper-based scheduling and management system with a website.
This new system will allow managers to add or remove clients, support staff members, and supported houses. To set up timetables and access appointment meeting notes. The manager will also have the facilities to create and change client support teams. 
Support staff members will be able to access their timetables. Their timetables will display which client they are to see and what time the appointment is to start.  They will be able to record when they started the support session, the support session ended, and what was done. Support staff members will also be able to send and receive messages related to a client they support and specify the importance of the message.
The system will handle potential problems like a client being assigned two or more key workers and timetable conflicts based around travel time and appointment availability between a client and support staff member. The system will also flag several set behavioural patterns, e.g., a client is continually cancelling support or a client withdrawing from the assistance of a specific support staff member.

nature and context of the problem

•	What is the problem that needs to be solved?
A reliance on using written documents to manage and record staff appointments and the need to use text messages and phone calls for passing client information between multiple support workers.

•	Why is it considered a problem?
Each support worker holds an extensive collection of paperwork related to each person they support this takes up support hours and means much time is spent checking paperwork from different support workers associated with a single client this can mean behavioural signs are missed.
Using phone calls to liaise between multiple support workers is difficult as a support worker may not be able to answer the phone in a support session this can have severe repercussions in the response time to a client in distress.

•	What will be the benefits of solving it?
Fewer support hours will be spent on paperwork. Introducing a priority-based messaging system will improve communication among support staff. The missing of messages being one of the most common complaints from support staff. 
Also, a system to automatically flag common behavioural signs and inform the specific client’s key worker ensuring these behavioural signs are not missed; this is one of the concerns for key workers that manage multiple clients with the most commonly missed behavioural sign being cancelled appointments. These will all help in the task of supporting clients.

•	What are the key ICT aspects of this problem?
To replace the current paper-based system with a website accessible from any device with a browser, this will allow access to and modification of information about appointments, appointment notes, clients, support staff members, and the charity-controlled houses that act as clients accommodation while at the charity.
The website will have the functionality to automatic handle some behavioural checks, message passing, retrieving information, or saving data to a database. Another problem will be the need for the system to be useable by support staff on the move. As most support staff will use the system moving between appointments. 

•	What is your existing knowledge of this problem?
I already possess the Java knowledge to create back-end object representations. Also, I have used some HTML and CSS before. The areas I will need to learn related to the back-end database design and on the Front-end, JavaScript, and JSON to update the web page. Restful API to pass JSON objects to and from the back-end Java. Also, linking the back-end java to the database through SQL.

•	What might the solution look like?
The solution will be a web app that runs through the device’s browser in the style of the charity’s homepage. The web app will implement responsive design so that functionality and layout will fit the screen size of the display. The plan will be different depending on who has been authenticated a manager or support staff member. A manager will most likely access the web app from a desktop PC and so have more screen space available where support staff members will be accessing the web app from a mobile device on the move.
The information displayed for a specific support staff member will be their appointments for that day, along with prioritised messages. The website will also have the facilities to access past appointment records, display information relating to a client, support worker, or the houses managed by the charity that act as client accommodation.

•	What, specifically, will you deliver by way of a project output?
A working prototype of the web application and documentation of the development process. A version of the Volere template and artefacts created during each increment’s analysis and design phase. e.g., class diagrams, object diagrams, and sequence diagrams where appropriate.
A working prototype of the web application will allow the stakeholders to give a final evaluation of the system. Also, documentation will enable them to continue the development of the system or its integration.

•	The scope of the system
The scope of the system will be limited to Appointment management, behavioural monitoring, and messaging. Anything outside of that core set of functionalities will be added to a waiting room of possible expansions to the system later.
